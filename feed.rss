<p><img src='https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/023/122/medium/PIC2.jpg'/></p> I built the entry level, paper-foldable spectrophotometer just before New Years. The experience I had and the lessons I learned are below. 1.) First, I tried it out of paper. That is super easy because you just have to print out the form, cut and then fold, but the paper is not thick enough to block out extraneous light. I was able to improve it by wrapping the front of the small box with black electrician's tape. It worked . . . sort of. 2.) Getting the aperature right is a big deal and not that easy to do. I ended up 3d printing an appoximate aperature and then using electrician's tape to make the aperature closer to the 0.4mm that is suggested. Unfortunately, my 3d printer is not accurate enough to just print a small slot like that. 3.) I'm getting spectral images from the CFL lights but the resolution is no where near the 1 nm that is mentioned as possible. Therefore, I'm ready to buy the desktop reference design with the web cam and the aperature kit. I think that will be easier to use (it is hard to hold the box onto your smartphone camera while snapping a picture) and hope that it will be more precise.

<p><img src='https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/023/110/medium/download.jpg'/></p> Although 71% of the Earth's surface is covered by water; 96.5% of such is oceanic water, leaving only 3.5% fresh water. 68.5% of that fresh water is within polar ice caps, glaciers and permanent snow. The remainder of fresh water resources are in the form of ground water, pallustrine water (swamp), riverine water (rivers), lacustrine water (lakes), atmospheric moisture and soil moisture. ![Image result for lake baikal siberia](<a href="https://i2.wp.com/todiscoverrussia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Wish-tree-on-cape-Burhan-of-Olkhon-Island-on-Lake-Baikal.jpg">https://i2.wp.com/todiscoverrussia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Wish-tree-on-cape-Burhan-of-Olkhon-Island-on-Lake-Baikal.jpg</a>) **Lake Baikal in Eastern Siberia, Russia** contains 20% of the earth's non-frozen fresh water. Baikal is the world's oldest lake ast 25 million years and the world's deepest lake at 1,700 meters. Lake Baikal is also home to the world's only fresh water chemosynthetic benthic community and the only fresh water seal species - Nerpa (_Pusa Siberica_). Despite its apparent importance and value to humanity, Baikal is threatened: - "A tourist boom, growing pollution and lack of sewage treatment has led to the disappearance of local fish species and a growth of putrid algae in Lake Baikal."The Guardian Oct. 19, 2017 "World's deepest lake crippled by putrid algae, poaching and pollution."

The scarcity of potable water is exacerbated by drought, desertification as well as by threats posed by water-borne diseases. Particularly within certain developing countries, where poverty and armed conflict combine to wreak havoc on vulnerable communities, water-borne diseases have become endemic.
