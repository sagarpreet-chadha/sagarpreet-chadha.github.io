As a strategy, it offers a concrete plan for how to stop that destruction. As an organization, Deep Green Resistance is implementing that strategy.  The goal of DGR is to deprive the rich of their ability to steal from the poor and the powerful of their ability to destroy the planet. This is a vast undertaking but it needs to be said: it can be done. Industrial civilization can be stopped.    DGR is an aboveground organization that uses direct action in the fight to save our planet. We also argue for the necessity of an underground that can target the strategic infrastructure of industrialization. But these actions alone are never a sufficient strategy for achieving a just outcome. Any strategy aiming for a livable future must include a call to build direct democracies based on human rights and sustainable material cultures.",

   "FIELD3": "Who we are: EDGE Philly is a group of activists & artists committed to Ending Dirty Gas Exploitation by Encouraging Development of a Green Economy.  We believe that the fight for environmental justice is inextricably linked to the fight against systemic oppressions such as racism, misogyny, and ableism. To value life means to value quality of life and equitable access to essential resources (clean air, water, and land) for all. EDGE feels that existing options for involvement led by NGOs and parachute activists aren’t the right fit for many people who are directly affected by fossil fuel infrastructure. People deserve the ability to act autonomously for their communities while still connecting to broader efforts.   What we do: EDGE engages in artful activism and pushes the boundaries of political engagement through direct action. We believe that making the experiences and needs of impacted communities central to our process helps us avoid false solutions.  Our strategies include extra-legal tactics and a commitment to public outreach and education.   Our current focus is building coalitions and strategy to push for a ban on fracking in PA and an end to fossil fuel infrastructure in Philadelphia. Philadelphia is targeted to become a fossil fuel hub, but the city already bears the brunt of fracked gas, oil transportation, and processing in the region. In addition to existing oil trains, natural gas pipelines, and refineries in the area, this hub would mean a massive build-out of additional pipelines, processing, and export facilities. EDGE works to build connections between the abuse of residents in the Pennsylvania shalefields and the income inequality and pollution of urban Philadelphia.",

Gas drilling threatens our land, air, and water, jeopardizing the economic and physical health of our communities. Thousands of wells, many miles of pipelines, and large noisy compressor stations could turn our rural communities into giant industrial zones. Therefore, we are joining together to: educate ourselves and our neighbors about the long-term negative economic, environmental, health, and community impacts of gas extraction by hydraulic fracturing; advocate for legislation to safeguard our communities from these threats; encourage the development of alternative, green, sustainable energy sources. We believe that all people have a right to clean air and pure water, and that it is our duty to preserve and protect the natural, scenic, historic, and commercial assets of this beautiful state we live in, for ourselves and future generations.",
